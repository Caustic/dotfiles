dotfiles
========

This is my collection of dotfiles and configurations.  Feel free to use them.

I've also got a [dotvim](https://github.com/abraithwaite/dotvim) repository because
it's basically like an IDE and I prefer to keep them logically separate.

Finally, I use Zsh with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) as
my configuration framework. (The theme for prezto I use is steef).
